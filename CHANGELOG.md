## 0.0.3 â€“ Jul 6, 2025

### ðŸ†• Added

* Introduced `BaseImageManager<TData>` abstract class to standardize image upload and delete behavior.
    * `uploadIfAvailable(...)` â€“ handles safe upload when file and entityId are provided.
    * `deleteIfAvailable(...)` â€“ handles conditional deletion if a URL is present.
    * Uses `Either<IFailure, bool>` for clean failure handling via `i_tdd` and `exception_type`.
    * Leverages `.handleReport()` for optional success message reporting after operations.

> âœ… Designed with SOLID principles to promote reusability and simplify extending image upload logic across platforms (Firebase, REST, etc).
