### Aug 17, 2025

### âœ¨ Updated

- Updated `fire_storage_impl` package


## 0.0.4
### Jul 29, 2025

### ðŸ”§ Changed

* Removed all implementation layers except the domain layer for file/image handling to improve decoupling and testability.
* Centralized registration of image upload data source using `registerImageUploaderGetItDi()` with enum `FileUploaderSourceType`.

  * Enables switching between `restApi` and `firebaseStorage` easily.

### ðŸ†• Added

* Enum `FileUploaderSourceType` for selecting upload strategy.
* `registerImageUploaderGetItDi()` method to abstract the DI setup based on the enum value.

> âœ… Aligns with SOLID principles (especially OCP & SRP) to allow scalable and flexible data source management.

## 0.0.3  
### Jul 6, 2025

### ðŸ†• Added

* Introduced `BaseImageManager<TData>` abstract class to standardize image upload and delete behavior.

  * `uploadIfAvailable(...)` â€“ handles safe upload when file and entityId are provided.
  * `deleteIfAvailable(...)` â€“ handles conditional deletion if a URL is present.
  * Uses `Either<IFailure, bool>` for clean failure handling via `i_tdd` and `exception_type`.
  * Leverages `.handleReport()` for optional success message reporting after operations.

> âœ… Designed with SOLID principles to promote reusability and simplify extending image upload logic across platforms (Firebase, REST, etc).

---
